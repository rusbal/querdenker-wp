Integrate IdeaScale crowdsourcing into WordPress without having to directly edit any template code.

== Description ==

The [IdeaScale](http://www.ideascale.com/ "IdeaScale") WordPress plugin makes it easy to integrate IdeaScale inline or popup crowdsource feedback system into WordPress without having to directly edit template code. From the [IdeaScale website](http://www.ideascale.com/application/ideascale/faq/index.html "IdeaScale FAQ"):

"IdeaScale is based on the simple model of crowdsourcing. It begins with an idea posted to your IdeaScale community by a user. Each idea can be expanded through comments by the community. The ultimate measure of an idea is determined by a voting system. Any idea can be voted to the top or buried back down to the bottom. It combines the "wisdom of the crowds" concept with Web 2.0 models like Digg."

Normally, JavaScript code has to be inserted on each page where you want IdeaScale to be used. That approach requires editing of templates and including conditionals based on post ID.

This plugin makes it easy to integrate IdeaScale on your posts and pages *without* editing templates.
